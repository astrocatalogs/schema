# Open Astronomy Catalog Schema v1.0

This document describes the standard Open Astronomy Catalog (OAC) JSON schema.

Each object should be contained with a single JSON file that contains a single object bearing the object's primary name, which when empty represents the minimum readable entry file:

```JSON
{
	"SN1987A":{}
}
```

To comply with the standard, the object should contain a `schema` key, where `schema` is a permanent URL to the version of this document defining the file's schema (with `commithash` replaced appropriately), and a `name` key, where the `name` key should be identical to the object field name:

```JSON
{
	"SN1987A":{
		"schema":"https://github.com/astrocatalogs/schema/README.md",
		"name":"SN1987A"
	}
}
```

As JSON is a serialized format, *field order does not matter*, but it is recommended to organize the data in the output JSON files to make them more readable (for instance we sort photometry and spectra within each file by date, the data quantity fields by name, etc.), and to make the outputs more friendly to version control.

Sources are extremely important in the OAC schema, and every single piece of data added to an event JSON file **must have a source attribution**. Published data sources are preferred over secondary sources (aggregators would fall into a secondary source category), but if the data was collected by a secondary source intermediate to being collected by the creator of the file, it is best practice to also include these sources in the source list.

To maintain precision across JSON readers, it is recommended that numerical values should be stored as *strings*, rather than as floats or integers, even if the field type listed below is float/integer. This enables the user to maintain precision on their imported valued with packages such as `Decimal`, instead of potentially losing precision upon loading the JSON.

Sources of data contain several fields:

| Field | Description | Type | Optional?
| :--- | :--- | :--- | ---
| `name` | Source name, e.g. "Catchpole et al. 1989" | String | no
| `alias` | ID number unique to this source to be used as an alias | Integer | no
| `url` | Web address of source | String | yes
| `bibcode` | 19 character NASA ADS bibcode | String | yes
| `doi` | Digital object identifier | String | yes
| `arxivid` | ArXiv ID number | String | yes
| `secondary` | Did this source collect the data from another source (i.e. second-hand source) | Boolean | yes
| `acknowledgment` | Acknowledgment requested by source if data is used in publication | String | yes

The sources object contains an array of such objects:

```JSON
"sources":[
	{
		"name":"Catchpole et al. (1987)",
		"bibcode":"1987MNRAS.229P..15C",
		"alias":"1"
	},
	{
		"name":"SUSPECT",
		"url":"https://www.nhn.ou.edu/~suspect/",
		"alias":"2",
		"secondary":true
	}
]
```

The OAC schema stores many different pieces of metadata for each event. Data quantities are added to each event as arrays of objects, with each piece of datum being tagged with its associated sources' alias tags. As an example a redshift object array may look like:

```JSON
"redshift":[
	{
		"value":"0.045",
		"e_value":"0.001",
		"source":"1,2",
		"kind":"heliocentric"
	},
	{
		"value":"0.043",
		"e_value":"0.002",
		"source":"3",
		"kind":"host"
	}
]
```

where in this example we have two different redshift values quoted from three different sources, where two of the sources agree with one another, and the third source actually refers to the redshift of the host galaxy rather than the supernova. Note that all the numerical quantities are stored as strings instead of as numbers, the OAC's policy is to store the data with exactly the same number of significant digits as the sources that provide them, and storing the importing the data as floating point numbers can often introduce small floating-point errors that we wish to avoid.

In general, the data stored in a given JSON file are presented in the observer frame, uncorrected for extinction or redshift, with times provided in MJD or as a calendar date (YYYY/MM/DD). In some instances, only corrected data will be available, or will be available as a supplement to the raw data, but in these cases the corrected data should be tagged with additional qualifiers (e.g. `kcorrected`, `deredshifted`, etc.) to indicate that it has been manipulated. As with all tags, the source material is often unclear in how they provided the data; we attempt to figure this out from the original publication when possible, but this cannot always be determined.

Data quantities have their own set of standard fields:

| Field | Description | Type | Optional?
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| `value` | The value of the quantity | String, Float, or Array | no
| `e_value` | The error associated with the value | Float | yes

| `upperlimit` | Value is an upper limit | Boolean | yes
| `u_value` | The unit of the value | String | yes
| `u_e_value` | The unit of the error in the value (if different from `u_value`) | String | yes
| `correlation` | Correlation of value with another value (structure described below) | Object | yes
| `kind` | Variant of the quantity | String | yes
| `derived` | Quantity is derived from other data present in file | Boolean | yes
| `description` | A description of the quantity | String | yes
| `probability` | Probability of the given value being true | Float | yes
| `source` | Comma-delimited list of integer aliases to sources for the data | String | no

| `realization` | A numeric ID for the realization of the denoted model (e.g. from Monte Carlo) | Integer | yes

Correlations between quantities can be specified with the correlation object, which has the following structre:

| Field | Description | Type | Optional?
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| `quantity` | Name of quantity this quantity is correlated with | String | no
| `value` | The value of the correlation | String or Float | no

So long as it is reasonable, the OAC is open to adding more field names should additional information need to be stored in an event file beyond the quantities and data we have chosen to track here, please contact us and let us know if you have any suggestions on how the standard format can be improved.
